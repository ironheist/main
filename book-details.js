        intro: "Grief is not a fleeting emotion; it lingers, shapes, and transforms us in ways we often fail to comprehend. Garden of Grief is not just a collection of poems—it is a quiet confession, an attempt to put into words the weight of sorrow, the echoes of love lost, and the search for meaning in suffering.<br><br>Each poem in this book is a piece of something I have lived through. They are remnants of nights spent overthinking, of days where silence spoke louder than words, of memories that refused to fade. These pages hold the ache of longing, the rage of betrayal, and the quiet realization that grief is, in its own way, a form of love that never found its place to rest.<br><br>This collection is divided into four parts:<br><br>A Diary of My Thoughts – A raw, unfiltered descent into love, heartbreak, and the turmoil of emotions left unspoken.<br><br>Midday Blues – A reflection on faith, identity, and the realization that not all wounds can be healed.<br><br>Fading Light? – The quiet acceptance of loss, the soft unraveling of love, and the inevitable passage of time.<br><br>Dawn & Dusk – A philosophical reckoning with existence, grief, and the duality of hope and despair.<br><br>This book is not meant to provide answers. It is meant to be read by those who have felt the same weight of emotions, by those who understand what it means to carry grief like a second skin. If you have ever loved and lost, if you have ever questioned the meaning of faith, if you have ever found comfort in sadness—then this book is for you.<br><br>These words exist as a testament that I was here, that I felt, and that I refused to let grief define me, even as it shaped me.",
