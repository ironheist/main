                intro: "Grief is not a fleeting emotion; it lingers, shapes, and transforms us in ways we often fail to comprehend. Garden of Grief is not just a collection of poems—it is a quiet confession, an attempt to put into words the weight of sorrow, the echoes of love lost, and the search for meaning in suffering.<br><br>Each poem in this book is a piece of something I have lived through. They are remnants of nights spent overthinking, of days where silence spoke louder than words, of memories that refused to fade. These pages hold the ache of longing, the rage of betrayal, and the quiet realization that grief is, in its own way, a form of love that never found its place to rest.<br><br>This collection is divided into four parts:<br><br>A Diary of My Thoughts – A raw, unfiltered descent into love, heartbreak, and the turmoil of emotions left unspoken.<br><br>Midday Blues – A reflection on faith, identity, and the realization that not all wounds can be healed.<br><br>Fading Light? – The quiet acceptance of loss, the soft unraveling of love, and the inevitable passage of time.<br><br>Dawn & Dusk – A philosophical reckoning with existence, grief, and the duality of hope and despair.<br><br>This book is not meant to provide answers. It is meant to be read by those who have felt the same weight of emotions, by those who understand what it means to carry grief like a second skin. If you have ever loved and lost, if you have ever questioned the meaning of faith, if you have ever found comfort in sadness—then this book is for you.<br><br>These words exist as a testament that I was here, that I felt, and that I refused to let grief define me, even as it shaped me.",

They speak of a heart tethered to another, of a life teetering between vitality and despair, and of words that serve as both lifeline and lament. This collection captures the masochistic pull of love, the weight of unshared pain, and the fragile hope of being remembered.<br><br><b>A Diary of My Thoughts</b> explores the depths of introspection, the sting of nostalgia, and the quiet rebellion against an ending that feels inevitable. It is for those who have lain awake with their own ghosts, who have poured their grief into ink, and who have found solace in the act of naming their shadows.<br><br>These pages are not a cure. They are a mirror for the sleepless, a diary for those who feel too much and fear they’ll fade unnoticed.",

They are born from restless nights chasing memories, from days questioning faith, and from the ache of a love that lingers like an uninvited guest. This collection grapples with the weight of unreciprocated words, the erosion of identity, and the seasons of life that shift beneath our feet—sometimes offering solace, sometimes leaving us stranded.<br><br><b>Midday Blues</b> explores themes of love’s quiet destruction, the illusion of freedom, and the poet’s wrestle with faith and forgiveness. These pages are for those who have felt the sting of silence, who have sought meaning in the chaos of their own emotions, and who have found poetry in the ruins of what once was.<br><br>This is not a book of resolution. It is a companion for those who carry their blues into the midday light, searching for a muse that may never return.",

From the desperate longing of unanswered letters to the quiet torment of memories that refuse to fade, these verses capture the ache of a heart stretched thin by absence. They are written in the haze of smoke and starlight, in the wreckage of dreams, and in the fleeting warmth of a touch that no longer exists.<br><br><b>Fading Light?</b> explores the duality of vulnerability and resilience, the weight of grief, and the haunting permanence of love lost to time. This collection is for those who have stared into the void of another’s absence, who have sought solace in the ashes of their own words, and who have felt the slow dimming of a once-bright bond.<br><br>These pages don’t promise dawn. They are a mirror to the dusk within us all, a quiet companion for when the light fades and the heart still beats.",

They are born from the green of lost summers, the stillness of frozen rivers, and the weight of memories that linger like uninvited guests. This collection wrestles with the duality of love and hate, the curse of longing, and the faint hope that flickers even in the darkest night.<br><br><b>Dawn & Dusk</b> delves into the complexities of overthinking, the permanence of loss, and the search for light amid life’s fractured mosaics. It is for those who have felt the chill of winter’s reign, who have questioned the mercy of gods, and who have sought meaning in the ruins of what once shone.<br><br>This book offers no easy answers.

Written in the shadow of heartbreak, these poems trace the descent from summer’s warmth to winter’s chill, capturing the pain of a love that consumes more than it gives. They are the echoes of a mind turned against itself, a soul grappling with the wreckage of what could have been.<br><br><b>A Letdown</b> delves into the price of devotion, the haunting presence of memory, and the quiet resignation of a future unseen. This book is for those who have paid love’s toll, who have felt the sting of betrayal or abandonment, and who have wondered if they’ll ever reclaim the pieces of themselves lost along the way.<br><br>These words stand as proof of survival—not triumph, but the persistence to feel, even when it hurts.",

They are written in the haze of heartbreak, in the clarity of dreams, and in the quiet of a mind searching for itself amid the ruins of another. This collection captures the thrill of love’s highs, the sting of its betrayals, and the slow crawl toward healing—or perhaps, toward forgetting.<br><br><b>Drunk Off Her</b> explores the complexity of attachment, the blur between reality and illusion, and the struggle to release a lover who has become both muse and nemesis.

They capture the warmth of longing, the weight of separation, and the beauty of a love that transforms even the darkest nights.
